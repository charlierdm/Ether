* Firstly, I created the sounds in Ableton Live using synths and effects.
* I then set up the react app so that when you press one of the respective qwerty keys, the audio is played until you let go or the sample ends. The audio fades out then back in using SetTimeOut.
* I created the buttons styling to light up on press and release and finally set the background colour to transition in and out with the audio.
